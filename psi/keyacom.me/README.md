# Keyacom.me

This was a project for a website I'd name **Keyacom.me** that I worked on in April 2022. I kept everything in the same folder.

## Some mistakes

- Breaking the DRY rule (mainly in inclusion of the same elements throughout my pages). Broke it because it was intended to be frontend-only.
- Not using `defer` in `<script>` tags: I only realized its power later as I was learning more about web development.
