# Reklama-anim

An animated advertisement of the programming major. My teacher asked us to install Google Web Designer, but something caused the GWD window to be all-white. So I decided to create it with just code.

Inspired by e.g. the cookies dialog at the [JetBrains' website](https://www.jetbrains.com/).
