# Form with Bootstrap and PHP

This is a form I made with Boostrap (through a CDN for simple inclusion) and PHP
(validation).

The form I made with the file named `...-php-lt-800.php` was the one I turned in
to my teacher because of a problem with the PHP version bundled with XAMPP (due
to the unrecognized `string|array` type hint).
