# jQuery Project: Pokémon website

A project site about Pokémon that I made in late September 2022.

Credit to Pokémon artworks goes to [Ken Sugimori](https://twitter.com/SUPER_32X). The Mew sprites come from the [Pokémon Showdown Pokédex](https://dex.pokemonshowdown.com/).

After this project, we'll start learning about PHP.
